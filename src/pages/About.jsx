      <div>Dear reader,</div>
      <div>
        If you have made it this far, I think it's time to properly introduce
        myself. My name is Mitch, and I'm an unstoppable force of nature who
        will achieve anything I put my mind to. Over the past two years, I have
        been honing my design and UX skills. As of fall 2023, I made a
        life-changing decision to join the Denver University Full Stack
        Development Boot Camp. It's been a wild journey, but I came out of it
        with incredible knowledge and a great new understanding of the software
        development world.

      <div>
        Prior to this experience, I graduated from college with a business major
        and a fine arts minor. Art and design have always driven me to new
        worlds and amazing self-discoveries. I believe that art touches all
        individuals, whether they believe it or not. That is what drove me to
        start pursuing my career in illustration and graphic design in 2018.

        In 2022, I left my management job to expand my own business and took up
        learning UX design. Later that year, I began experimenting with Swift
        (Apple's app language), and I really enjoyed it (even though I wasn't
        very good at it). That's when I decided to join the development
        community by taking steps to attend Denver University (my third time in
        college üôÑ).

        After the most eventful two years of my life, including moving to
        Denver, and making a significant career change, I'm glad to present you all
        with this portfolio.
      </div>
      <div>
        I hope you enjoy it, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach
        out to me!
